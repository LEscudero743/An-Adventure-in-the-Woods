        <div class="title"> They said that the woods in your town were cursed. At least you thought that they were. It was an unwritten rule that you were to never go near them. You, being the curious soul that you are, found yourself in front of those Cursed Woods™ one night. Do you enter the Cursed Woods™?</div>
        <div class="button">
            <button class="yes-button">Cursed Woods™,here we go!</button>
            <button class="no-button"> No, thank you.</button>
        </div>

        <div class="Part-Two-Yes">
            <h1>Yay</h1>
            <h1>Spoopy woods adventure here we go!</h1>
            <h1>You begin your journey into the woods. It's a dark, moonless night, because of course it is. Why would it be in the middle of a nice, sunny day? Anyways, the path before you starts to change from dirt to grass. You'll need to be careful not to get turned around, else you'll be lost. There's a rustling sound to your left. The source of the sound seems to be a humanoid figure cloaked in shadow. Do you approach it?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="button">
            <button class="y-button">What could go wrong? Hello, shadowy figure!</button>
            <button class="n-button">Yeah, no. Not toady...</button>
        </div>
        <div class="Part-Two-No">
            <h1> You decide to "nope" out of the Cursed Woods™ situation. Was that the right choice? What would have happened if you went into the Cursed Woods™? Every now and then, usually when you find yourself the happiest you've ever been, you think back to the woods and the possible fun adventure you could have went on. This intrusive thought always ruins your mood. You learn to avoid happy situations so you don't have to feel that dread. It doesn't always work though, so you push everyone away to avoid those negative feelings. Now you're alone. Would the occasional bad thought have been as bad as your isolation? You'll never know though. You die all alone, never knowing what the Cursed Woods™ could have brought, or the wonderful life you could have lead if you let yourself feel happiness. Too bad you can't change things, huh? </h1>

            <h1>Was this a good idea? Doesn't matter now. They've seen you. Plus, you've strayed far enough from the trail that it disappeared. Great. Oh look, now they're walking towards you. As they come closer, you can start to make out details about them. They look almost, feral. Like they've never left the Cursed Woods™ before. They raise their hand as if to strike. You close your eyes, waiting for the hit, but nothing happens. You open your eyes and see that they've extended their hand towards you. Do they want you to take it? Better not take too long. They look impatient.</h1>

            <h1>You move away from the figure as quietly as possible. It takes what seems to be hours before they finally fade from view. Fortunately, you got away without being noticed! Unfortuantely, you are nowhere near the path you entered on. You, not anticipating staying out for this long, started to develop hypothermia. Why would you prepare to survive freezing temperatures? This was supposed to be a quick trip, afterall. Anyhow, you end up freezing to death. Maybe you should have taken your chances with that stranger. Would your death by their hands have been less painful? Probably. You'll never know now. You're dead. Hope you find the warmth you lacked in life,er, the last few hours of your life, I should say.</h1>
